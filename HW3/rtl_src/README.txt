Assignment 3
Jose Manuel Lopez Alcala

The assignment works in the "code" version. I was not able to get it working in the gate level and I think it was due
 to the timing parameters in the "force -freeze" part of the mult2.do file. The "gate" implementation would not run at the
 nanoseconds scale so I changed it to the picosecond scale. I don't know what the correct parameters should be for this to work; if you would happen to know what the correct nubmers
 should be it would most likely run as expected. Thank you for the extra time to try to get this to work, I really spent many hours trying to get this
 to work, but in the end I wasn't successful.
